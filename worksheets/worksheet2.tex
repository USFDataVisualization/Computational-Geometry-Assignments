\section{Assignment}

\begin{enumerate}
\item For the following polygon:
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw all possible edges between non-adjacent vertices. 
\item Denote those segments which are diagonals and those which are not. 
\item For non-diagonal segments, state the reason they are not considered diagonal. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Is the polygon convex? Why or why not?
\end{itemize}



\item Given the 2 convex polygons, $A$ and $B$, show the steps of the $O(M+N)$ algorithm to find $A \cap B$ discussed in class. Your algorithm should start at $a_0$ and $b_0$.

\begin{itemize}
\item Describe how you would modify the algorithm to find $A \cup B$, $A \backslash B$, and $A \ominus B$. (hint: describe it in terms of inner and outer chains.)
\end{itemize}
