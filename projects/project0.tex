\section{Objectives}

\myparagraph{This assignment will help you become familiar with Processing and build some basic data structures for storing geometric data.}

\section{Ground Rules}

\myparagraph{This assignment is intended to be done alone. You may ask others for help with figuring out how to use the program. However, the write-up and its ideas should be developed by you.}

\section{Assignment Instructions}

\begin{itemize}

\item Download and familiarize yourself with Processing (\url{http://processing.org/download/}). Use the available tutorials (\url{http://processing.org/tutorials/}) and examples (\url{http://processing.org/examples/}) to help you understand how Processing works.


\item Use the provided skeleton code to complete a sketch with the following requirements.

\begin{itemize}

\item When the mouse is clicked, a new point should be added to the point list. This point should be drawn using an ellipse and include a label.

\item Every point should be connected to the previously added point with an edge in the edge list. The edges list should be drawn every frame.

\item Every 3 points should form a triangle that is added to the triangle list. The triangles should be drawn and colored based upon whether they are stored in a clockwise or counterclockwise order.

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}



\section{Submission}

\myparagraph{Compress your sketch into a single zip file and upload to canvas.}
