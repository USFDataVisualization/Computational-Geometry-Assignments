\section{Ground Rules}

\myparagraph{This assignment is intended to be done alone. You may ask others for help with figuring out strategies. However, the code must be yours.}

\section{Assignment Instructions}

\begin{itemize}

\item Download the provided skeleton code and complete the unfinished functions in \texttt{ConvexHull.pde}.

\begin{itemize}

   \item \texttt{Polygon ConvexHullGiftWrapped( ArrayList<Point> points )} --- Takes in a list of points and returns a polygon that should be the convex hull of the points.
   
\end{itemize}

\item To test your code the Processing skeleton provided gives visual feedback for creating random point sets and testing your capabilities.

\end{itemize}
