\item Use the following page to show the steps of the algorithm. Print off as many copies as you need, though you may not need all copies of the point set. 

\item Use each steps to determine the best/average/worst case big-O performance for a single iteration. 
\item Combine that information to determine the best/average/worst case big-O for the entire computation.

\end{itemize}
